\item Use (2.5.3) to show that $\PP^n$ is simply connected.

\item \textit{Classification of Curves of Genus 2.} Fix an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$.
\begin{enumerate} [label=(\alph*)]
  \item If $X$ is a curve of genus 2 over $k$, the canonical linear system $|K|$ determines a finite morphism $f : X \to \PP^1$ of degree 2 (Ex. 1.7). Show that it is ramified at exactly 6 points, with ramification index 2 at each one.
  Note that $f$ is uniquely determined, up to an automorphism of $\PP^1$, so $X$ determines an (unordered) set of 6 points of $\PP^1$, up to an automorphism of $\PP^1$.

  \item Conversely, given six distinct elements $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_6 \in k$, let $K$ be the extension of $k(x)$ determined by the equation $z^2 = (x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x-\alpha_6)$.
  Let $f : X \to \PP^1$ be the corresponding morphism of curves.
  Show that $g(X) = 2$, the map $f$ is the same as the one determined by the canonical linear system, and $f$ is ramified over the six points $x = \alpha_i$ of $\PP^1$, and nowhere else.
